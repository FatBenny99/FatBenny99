### Projects ###
- [Thesis - Automatic deployment of network security functions with Docker Compose](https://github.com/FatBenny99/Thesis-Verefoo) - Individual<br>
Within this work, VEREFOO(VErified REFinement and Optimized Orchestration) was designed, a framework capable of automatically allocating and configuring Network Security Functions (NSFs) to meet user-defined input security requirements. Early versions of the framework were able to uniquely allocate in one iteration only one type of Network Security Functions, usually Firewalls or VPN Gateways. The work in this paper describes and promotes an updated version of the framework, which is able in a single iteration to allocate both of the described NSFs simultaneously. It also describes the process of design, development, and implementation of two Demos produced to show the potential of the framework.<br>
Leveraged knowledge: Docker compose, Virtualization, Secure comunication , Java, Bash.

- [Medical-Reality](https://github.com/FatBenny99/Medical-Reality) - Teamwork<br>
Web application developed with React 3D that can provide interactive lessons for medical students approaching their first experiences in hospital internships. The idea of the project is to speed up the learning of the simplest medical techniques to speed up the onsite education process.<br>
Leveraged knowledge: Javascript, React 3D

- [Pong](https://github.com/FatBenny99/Pong) - Individual<br>
  The first very famous Pong video game developed on a LandTiger LPC1768 ARM board. This project aimed to learn how to use C and Assembly to control a physical board. An equivalent board or emulator is required to compile the project. <br>
  Leveraged knowledge: Embedded C, Assembly

- [Neon Nightmare](https://github.com/chettilaura/Neon-Nightmare) - Teamwork<br>
